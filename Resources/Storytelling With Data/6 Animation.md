# Graphs Presentation

Use animations not for whimsy but for narrative direction.

Presenting a complete and complex graph which includes all data points, annotations, and calls to action may be appropriate when distributing the materials for those who missed the presentation. But during the presentation itself, displaying a complete graph may overwhelm the viewer and while they are reading the graph they are not listening. So instead guide the viewer by presenting the graph piece by piece. This way you control the pace and what they should be focusing on and when.

**Guide the viewer**

*Worldbuilding*
- **Say** : I'm going to walk you through { plot title | key take away }. First let's look at the set up { explain x and y axis , the duration , the units }.
- **Show** : the title, axis, axis labels

*Inciting Incident*
- **Say** : We launched our product on { some date } and within a { some duration } we had 1000 active users.
- **Show** : only that specific data point

*Rising Action*
- **Say** : Even though we had no marketing, active users doubled in the first quarter.
- **Show** : upward trend line segment connecting the starting point and the end of quarter point

Continue adding segments and describing the general trajectory for each one. Don't just state the trend but excitedly and briefly explain what lead to it. Don't use "and then" instead use but, however, and yet, regardless, in contrast to. The use of contrasting conjoiners helps keep the audience engaged.

*Call to Action*
- **Say** : By doing { some action } we will { increase , reverse , improve by }
- **Show** : highlight a range of recommended { prices , staff , resources }

*Denouement*
- **Say** : Reiterate the issue , the key points , and the call to action.
- **Show** : the completed graph including notes and highlights
