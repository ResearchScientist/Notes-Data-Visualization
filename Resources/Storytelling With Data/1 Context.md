>  Understand the context.

But first : Exploratory vs Explanatory

In exploratory analysis you explore all the data looking for the interesting bits.
In explanatory analysis you want to explain only the interesting bits, not the whole data.

# Outline
## Who

### *Audience*

Segment and target your audience.

- who are the stakeholders
- who is the key decision maker
### *You*

What is your relationship with the audience.

- is this your first encounter with each other
- do they already know you
- do they already trust you as an expert
- do you need to work to establish credibility

## What

### *Action*

- what is it you want the audience to know
- what is it you want the audience to do

If you simply present the data, the audience may think how interesting and move on.
If you ask for an action then the audience has to make a decision about committing or not, this can prompt a more productive conversation.

### *Medium*

- presentation
- report
- email

### *Tone*

- celebratory
- urgent call to action
- casual
- formal
- light
- serious

## How

Determine what story you want to tell.
### *Evidence*

Data is proof for the points your story is making.
### *Counterpoints*

Balance your story by addressing counterpoints to your claims. This shows a fair and balanced assessment of the data and builds trust in your presentation.

# Big Idea

# Storyboards

Use a white board and sticky notes.

This makes it easy to move things around and see how the flow affects the impact of the message. Perhaps sometimes moving recommendations to the beginning instead of the end is more effective.

- easy to iterate changes
- can visualize information flow
- can visualize hero journey
- can visualize emotional impact
