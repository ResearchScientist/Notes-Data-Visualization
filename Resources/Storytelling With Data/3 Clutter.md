Eliminate clutter.

# Cognitive Load

Due to finite attention and processing, overwhelming graphics can lead to Information overload. Which in turn leads to avoidant behaviours.

Even just the perception of a high cognitive load can trigger the avoidant behaviours.

Solution : 
- focus salient data
- reduce unnecessary clutter
- maximize the signal to noise ratio

| Connectedness             | Objects connected to each other are perceived as a group.                                                                                                                                                                              | A trend line connecting points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Enclosure - Common Region | Objects within the same enclosure are perceived as grouped together.                                                                                                                                                                   | Borders or shading can enclose objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Proximity                 | Objects that are physically close together are perceived as belonging to the same group.                                                                                                                                               | A grid of dots can form columns or rows by increasing space between them.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Common Fate               | Objects moving in the same direction or that appear to head towards the same end point are perceived as a group.                                                                                                                       | A flock of birds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Continuity                | The eyes tend to follow along a smooth path. When a part is missing they will continue along the same path until smoothly reaching the closest path that appears to continue the previous one, instead of abruptly changing direction. | An X is perceived as 2 separate lines instead of 4 lines originating from a common center point.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Closure                   | Mind wants to complete incomplete shapes or forms. It imagines a complete shape even when parts of it are missing.                                                                                                                     | An obstructed star shape is perceived as a whole star.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Similarity                | Objects of similar size, shape, colour, or orientation are perceived as belonging to the same group.                                                                                                                                   | A physically evenly distributed collection of red and green dots will be perceived as 2 separate groups.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Figure - Ground           | The mind can separate the foreground, focal point, main figure from the background.                                                                                                                                                    | A vase or 2 faces depending on which is considered the background. In contrast the duck rabbit illusion is an example of multistability, there is no foreground or background to focus on, instead the mind chooses how to categorise the object as a whole. |
| Symmetry and Order        | The mind prefers simple geometry over complex geometry.                                                                                                                                                                                | The olympic rings are perceived as interlocked circles instead of curved broken lines.                                                                                                                                                                       |
