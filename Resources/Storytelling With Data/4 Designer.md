Think like a designer.
# Affordances

Design choices that make it obvious how the product is to be used.

Draw attention and form a hierarchy with
- size
- colour
- typeface
- case
- highlight
- bold , italics, underline

Remove distractions by
- removing non essential data
- reducing details to their bare minimum
- summarizing with a few words not full paragraphs
- using pre attentive attributes to de-emphasize non critical items to the background (light gray)
- asking yourself "will deleting this item change anything?" , if no , delete it
# Accessibility

This means making the graph easier to read for the target audience.

- define abbreviations
- use annotations on the graph itself to tell a story

Use descriptive titles.

- Don't simply state the chart representation in the title.
- Call out a trend or add a specific call to action.

If it makes sense for your use case the subtitle can be used for the call to action.
But be aware this makes it less important than if it was placed in the title.
# Aesthetics

Vertical and Horizontal alignment.
Make use of continuity by 
- aligning elements so they form natural invisible edges between them
- justify title and subtitle to the edge to form invisible lines

Use white space to
- allow the graph room to breathe
- allow data to present itself
- act as a canvas around the graph
# Acceptance

Present
- articulate the benefits of the new vis or approach
- show them side by side
- design multiple variants and get feedback or vote

Get an ally
- identify an influential stakeholder
- get their feedback and incorporate their suggestions
- if they advocate for the design others may buy in

Test
- new visual and old visual with a non biased or non vested individual
- have them walk you through their though process
- what do they like , not like
- what questions do they have
- which one do they prefer and why
