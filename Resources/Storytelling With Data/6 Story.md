# What is a Story

A story expresses how and why life changes.

Stories begin with a balanced state. Then something happens that throws that off.
"Subjective expectation meets cruel reality." - Robert McKee

Questions for finding a story
- what does the protagonist want in order to restore balance in their life
- what is their core need
- what is keeping them from achieving their desire
- how will they decide to act to attain their desire in the face of antagonistic forces

Questions after finding a story
- is this believable
- is it not an exaggeration
- is it not a watered down struggle
- is it an honest narrative

# Writing a Story

- find a subject you care about
- genuine caring will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style
- be brief, say just enough to convey the meaning, emotion, intent
- consider the audience

# Constructing a Story

***First Act***

Goal
- pick the audience interest
	- why should they pay attention
	- what's in it for them
- this is usually stated as the problem they are facing and the solution you're offering
- this stirs tension 'the conflict between what is and what could be'

***Second Act***

Goals
- substantiate the 'what could be'
- convince the audience for the need for action
- address how they can solve the problem you announced
- convince them why they should accept your proposed solution

When substantiating your claims
- consider what the audience resonates with emotionally
- consider what the audience is motivated by
	- money , status , competition , resource saving
- make the audience the hero of the story

Content
- relevant background info
- examples that illustrate the problem
- data that validates the problem
- describe what will happen if no action is taken or no change is made
- discuss potential options
- illustrate the benefits of your solution
- express why the audience is in a unique position to make a decision or take action

***Third Act***

Goal
- call to action
- make it clear what you want the audience to do with the new knowledge they now have
- tie it back to the dramatic tension you initially introduced
- reiterating the urgency at the end allows you to set the audience off with a clear direction and motivation to act

# Narrative Flow

Prior to structuring the order of the slide deck, make sure you have written the 3 minute story and most importantly the 1 sentence big idea. This will help you keep your story focused. 

Consider the order in which you want the audience to experience your story.

- are they new and you need to establish credibility
- are they busy and want you to tell them what you need from them up front
- are they interested in the process or only the answer
- is it a collaborative story and you need their input
- how can you best convince them

***Repetition***

Good to include in all variations.
- The first slide should serve as an executive summary telling the audience "here's what we will cover in our time together".  Include a bullet list of your main points.
- Order the rest of the slides in the same order as the bullet points. 
- Last slide tells the audience "here's what we covered". Restate any calls to action here.

***Chronological***

Best when audience cares about the process.
- how you identified the problem
- how you identified the required data
- how you acquired the data
- how you analyzed the data
- how you interpreted the data
- how you explored solutions
- how you decided on the best solution

***Lead With the Prize***

Best when the audience previously trusts you. This also makes it clear what lens they are expected to view the presentation under.
- lead with the call to action
- provide the critical validations for it

# Repetition

- Tell them what you're going to tell them.
- Tell them.
- Tell them what you told them.

# Slide Deck Flow

***Horizontal Logic***

Each slide deck title contributes to the overall story you are communicating.

- One of the first slides should be an executive summary.
- Below the summary include a bulleted list of the upcoming slide titles in order.
- Each title should be an action , not a description.

Simply reading the slide titles should communicate the story to the audience.

***Vertical Logic***

All information on a particular slide is self reinforcing.

- Title reinforces content.
- Content reinforces title.
- Visuals reinforce text.
- Text reinforce visuals.

There is no unrelated or extraneous information on any slide.

***Reverse Storyboarding***

Test if the flow of the completed slide deck matches your original storyboard.

- For each slide write the main point or take away.
- Compare with the original storyboard.
- Decide if changes are necessitated.

***Fresh Perspective***

Show the slide deck to someone who lacks context.

Ask

- tell me what you pay attention to
- what do you think is important
- where do you have questions

Their responses give you direction on where to iterate.

# Talk Tips

In a talk you control the frame.
The topic, the pace, the level of engagement is all up to you.

That's why at the beginning of the talk you must clearly articulate to the audience
- the role you want them to play
- the structure of the presentation

To help prevent interruptions and impromptu questions let them know there will be a QA section at the end.
"Jot down any questions you have as they come up and we will address any that haven't been answered at the end of the talk."

When leading with the ask, inform the audience that you are starting with the ask, then outline the structure of the presentation for them. This helps them view the presentation with the appropriate lens.
"Today, I'm going to start with what we're asking of you. We performed robust analysis that led to this conclusion. We weighted several solutions. I will walk you through this process. Before I do, I want to spotlight what we're asking of you. Which is . . . "

# Silent Deck Tips

When sending out your slide deck for those who didn't attend, it's imperative to explicitly provide the context for the talk.

In addition, each slide should be accompanied with an explanation of its key take away.

If there was a QA session in the presentation, include a list of the QAs addressed with the slide deck.
