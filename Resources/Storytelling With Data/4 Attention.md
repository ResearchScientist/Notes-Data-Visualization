- [Iconic](4%20Attention.md##Iconic)
- [Short Term](4%20Attention.md##Short%20Term)
- [Long Term](4%20Attention.md##Long%20Term)

## *Iconic*

Initial visual sensory capture. Holds a vast quantity of information. Much more than can be processed in short term memory. The only information that moves onto short term memory is that which is attended to.
## *Short Term*

Short term memory storage. Also called working memory.
Requires conscious effort to attend to. Rehearsal helps in extending its duration.
## *Long Term*

Long term memory storage. Comprises many regions for coordination, consolidation, and storage.

Table comparing iconic, short term, and long term memory in terms of duration in ms, capacity to hold information, and regions involved. 

| Memory     | Duration | Capacity                    | Regions                                                     |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Iconic     | ~ 500ms  | much higher than short term | occipital lobe                                              |
| Short Term | ~ 30s    | ~ 7 items                   | prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, hippocampus               |
| Long Term  | infinite | infinite                    | hippocampus, neocortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, amygdala |

# Pre Attentive Attributes

- position
- size
- color
- length
- orientation

These can be used to :

1. direct the user's attention
2. create a visual roadmap for the user to follow so they process information in the order you set out
